# Simple Crowdsale

This repository contains a simple (and poorly tested) crowdsale contract written in Solidity, using the latest version of Truffle for testing.

To run:
 - Make sure ganache-cli is initialized in another window/tab in the terminal
 - run truffle test

 This will go through all test cases pushing what the crowdsale model can do, including refunds, withdraw limits, and voting consensus
